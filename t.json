Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading complication in type 2 diabetes patients. Recently, we have shown that the reticulum-mitochondria Ca2+ uncoupling is an early and reversible trigger of the cardiac dysfunction in a diet-induced mouse model of DCM. Metformin is a first-line antidiabetic drug with recognized cardioprotective effect in myocardial infarction. Whether metformin could prevent the progression of DCM remains not well understood. We therefore investigated the effect of a chronic 6-week metformin treatment on the reticulum-mitochondria Ca2+ coupling and the cardiac function in our high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) mouse model of DCM. Although metformin rescued the glycemic regulation in the HFHSD mice, it did not preserve the reticulum-mitochondria Ca2+ coupling either structurally or functionally. Metformin also did not prevent the progression towards cardiac dysfunction, i.e., cardiac hypertrophy and strain dysfunction. In summary, despite its cardioprotective role, metformin is not sufficient to delay the progression to early DCM.", "denotations": [{"id": "35408928_0", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 19}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 43}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_2", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 100}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35408928_3", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_4", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 149}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_5", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 200}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_6", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 209}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35408928_7", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 271}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_8", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_9", "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 368}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35408928_10", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 392}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_11", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 491}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_12", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 510}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_13", "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 643}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_14", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 688}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_15", "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 751}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_16", "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 770}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35408928_17", "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 803}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_18", "span": {"begin": 849, "end": 853}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35408928_19", "span": {"begin": 902, "end": 906}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_20", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 962}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35408928_21", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_22", "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35408928_23", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Chemical"}], "attributes": [{"id": "35408928_0_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_0", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_1_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_1", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D000069285"}, {"id": "35408928_2_Species", "subj": "35408928_2", "pred": "species", "obj": "10090"}, {"id": "35408928_3_Disease", "subj": "35408928_3", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D003920"}, {"id": "35408928_4_Disease", "subj": "35408928_4", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D058065"}, {"id": "35408928_5_Disease", "subj": "35408928_5", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D003920"}, {"id": "35408928_6_Species", "subj": "35408928_6", "pred": "species", "obj": "9606"}, {"id": "35408928_7_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_7", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D000069285"}, {"id": "35408928_8_Disease", "subj": "35408928_8", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D006331"}, {"id": "35408928_9_Species", "subj": "35408928_9", "pred": "species", "obj": "10090"}, {"id": "35408928_10_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_10", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_11_Disease", "subj": "35408928_11", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D009203"}, {"id": "35408928_12_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_12", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_13_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_13", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_14_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_14", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D000069285"}, {"id": "35408928_15_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_15", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D013395"}, {"id": "35408928_16_Species", "subj": "35408928_16", "pred": "species", "obj": "10090"}, {"id": "35408928_17_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_17", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_18_Species", "subj": "35408928_18", "pred": "species", "obj": "10090"}, {"id": "35408928_19_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_19", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D000069285"}, {"id": "35408928_20_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_20", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}, {"id": "35408928_21_Disease", "subj": "35408928_21", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D006331"}, {"id": "35408928_22_Disease", "subj": "35408928_22", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D006332"}, {"id": "35408928_23_Chemical", "subj": "35408928_23", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D008687"}]}

Mothers' antenatal strategies to improve the intrauterine environment can positively decrease pregnancy-derived intercurrences. By challenging the mother-fetus unit, gestational exercise (GE) favorably modulates deleterious stimuli, such as high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced adverse consequences for offspring. We aimed to analyze whether GE alters maternal HFHS-consumption effects on male offspring's maximal workload performance (MWP) and in some skeletal muscle (the soleus-SOL and the tibialis anterior-TA) biomarkers associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative fitness. Infant male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into experimental groups according to mothers' dietary and/or exercise conditions: offspring of sedentary control diet-fed or HFHS-fed mothers (C-S or HFHS-S, respectively) and of exercised HFHS-fed mothers (HFHS-E). Although maternal HFHS did not significantly alter MWP, offspring from GE dams exhibited increased MWP. Lower SOL AMPk levels in HFHS-S were reverted by GE. SOL PGC-1alpha, OXPHOS C-I and C-IV subunits remained unaltered by maternal diet, although increased in HFHS-E offspring. Additionally, GE prevented maternal diet-related SOL miR-378a overexpression, while upregulated miR-34a expression. Decreased TA C-IV subunit expression in HFHS-S was reverted in HFHS-E, concomitantly with the downregulation of miR-338. In conclusion, GE in HFHS-fed dams increases the offspring's MWP, which seems to be associated with the intrauterine modulation of SM mitochondrial density and functional markers.", "denotations": [{"id": "35409278_0", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 352}, "obj": "Chemical"}, {"id": "35409278_1", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 460}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35409278_2", "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 716}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35409278_3", "span": {"begin": 956, "end": 969}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35409278_4", "span": {"begin": 1061, "end": 1065}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "35409278_5", "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1118}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "35409278_6", "span": {"begin": 1279, "end": 1287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "35409278_7", "span": {"begin": 1322, "end": 1329}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "35409278_8", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Gene"}], "attributes": [{"id": "35409278_0_Chemical", "subj": "35409278_0", "pred": "chemical", "obj": "MESH:D013395"}, {"id": "35409278_1_Disease", "subj": "35409278_1", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D000079262"}, {"id": "35409278_2_Species", "subj": "35409278_2", "pred": "species", "obj": "10116"}, {"id": "35409278_3_Disease", "subj": "35409278_3", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D000079262"}, {"id": "35409278_4_Gene", "subj": "35409278_4", "pred": "gene", "obj": "78975"}, {"id": "35409278_5_Gene", "subj": "35409278_5", "pred": "gene", "obj": "83516"}, {"id": "35409278_6_Gene", "subj": "35409278_6", "pred": "gene", "obj": "100314258"}, {"id": "35409278_7_Gene", "subj": "35409278_7", "pred": "gene", "obj": "100314015"}, {"id": "35409278_8_Gene", "subj": "35409278_8", "pred": "gene", "obj": "100313978"}]}

When students drop out of high school, this is often negative for their development as well as for society, as those who drop out have an increased risk of unemployment, health problems, and social problems. The aim of the present study was to synthesize knowledge regarding processes related to school dropout in general and school re-enrollment in particular. We performed a narrative review of the literature, focusing on Norwegian and Nordic studies, but we also included studies from other countries when relevant. We discussed the findings in relation to attachment theory and our own research on the topic. As a result, we identified five main challenges to upholding education-related goals in long-term dropout processes: lack of relatedness, overchallenged self-regulation capacity, compensating for a history of failure, wounded learner identities, and coping with prolonged stress. In conclusion, the identified challenges converged on the importance of belonging and social support. The prerequisite for addressing the challenges seemed to be the establishment of a trustful relationship between the students who have dropped out and at least one teacher, and preferably also with other supportive adults. These relationships may provide sufficient social support and aid the students' motivation to complete school.", "denotations": [{"id": "35409628_0", "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 60}, "obj": "Species"}, {"id": "35409628_1", "span": {"begin": 1029, "end": 1035}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35409628_2", "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1427}, "obj": "Gene"}], "attributes": [{"id": "35409628_0_Species", "subj": "35409628_0", "pred": "species", "obj": "9606"}, {"id": "35409628_1_Disease", "subj": "35409628_1", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D000079225"}, {"id": "35409628_2_Gene", "subj": "35409628_2", "pred": "gene", "obj": "57379"}]}

Despite the high prevalence of adverse health and trauma-related outcomes associated with intimate partner violence (IPV), help-seeking and service utilization among survivors is low. This study is part of a larger mixed-methods and survivor-centered validation study on the Icelandic Barriers to Help-Seeking for Trauma (BHS-TR) scale, a new barriers measure focused on trauma recovery. A mixed-methods legitimation strategy of integration was employed to evaluate the BHS-TR structure in samples of IPV survivors. The merging of qualitative (n = 17) and quantitative (n = 137) data through a joint display analysis revealed mainly complementarity findings, strengthening the scale's overall trustworthiness and validity evidence. Divergent findings involved items about mistrust, perceived rejection, stigmatization, fearing vulnerability, and safeguarding efforts that were significant help-seeking barriers in the survivors' narratives, whereas factor analysis indicated their removal. These BHS-TR items were critically evaluated in an iterative spiraling process that supported the barriers' influence, illuminated core issues, and guided potential refinements. This work contributes to the growing field of mixed methods instrument validation placing equal status on qualitative and quantitative methods and emphasizing integration to provide more complete insights.

{"sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "35410328", "text": "Translation, adaptation, and validation of the Self-efficacy in Palliative Care scale (SEPC) for use in Swedish healthcare settings. BACKGROUND: One challenge for healthcare professionals when delivering palliative care can be their lack of confidence. The Self-efficacy in Palliative Care Scale (SEPC) is considered a valid and reliable assessment scale to evaluate confidence when delivering palliative care. Currently, there is not a reliable instrument aimed to measure healthcare professionals' confidence in palliative care in Swedish. Therefore, this study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the SEPC-scale for use in a Swedish healthcare context. METHODS: This study applied the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines for translating and adapting instruments, using forward and back-translation, an expert panel, and cognitive interviews. Swedish experts in palliative care (n = 6) assessed the Swedish version of the SEPC-scale based on its relevance, understandability, clarity, and sensitivity on a Likert scale. Methods involved calculation of content validity index (CVI) with modified kappa statistics and cognitive interviewing with healthcare professionals (n = 10) according to the \"think-aloud\" method. RESULTS: Calculation of I-CVI (Item-CVI) showed that the Swedish SEPC-scale was considered relevant but needed some modifications to improve its understandability and clarity. The experts recognized an absence of precision in some items that affected clarity and understanding. Likewise, the healthcare professionals highlighted some challenges with understandability and clarity. They indicated that the scale was relevant, but a few items needed adjustment to fit a broader range of healthcare professionals. Items that referred to death and dying could be sensitive but were considered relevant. CONCLUSIONS: The SEPC-scale is considered valid for use in Swedish healthcare practice, for a broad range of healthcare professionals, and for diagnoses other than cancer. This study shows that cultural adaptation is necessary for establishing relevance and enabling acceptance to various healthcare professionals and contexts in the target country.", "denotations": [{"id": "35410328_0", "span": {"begin": 1777, "end": 1782}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "35410328_1", "span": {"begin": 2006, "end": 2012}, "obj": "Disease"}], "attributes": [{"id": "35410328_0_Disease", "subj": "35410328_0", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D003643"}, {"id": "35410328_1_Disease", "subj": "35410328_1", "pred": "disease", "obj": "MESH:D009369"}]}
